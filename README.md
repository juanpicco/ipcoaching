# ipcoaching

Self-taught programmer making my way into the it world. This will be my first website. Im going to try to do a responsive website to introduce myself to the world of IT, on it I will talk a little bit of my personal experience on the world of programing and my experience as a personal trainer and a physical education coach.

I will try to apply all the knowledge i've earn in my years of coaching into this new career and life-style, I hope someone will help me along the way, and I will be more than happy to help you back! Lets get going.
